### Problem Statement  

This dataset is designed to predict graduate admission chances from an Indian perspective. It includes key factors influencing a student's application for a Master's program, such as academic scores, standardized test results, and other relevant criteria. By applying a classification algorithm, the model provides a reliable estimate of a student's likelihood of admission, helping applicants assess their chances effectively.
